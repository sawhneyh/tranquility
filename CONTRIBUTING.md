# How to Contribute

Tranquility generally follows the same contributing guidelines as Druid. See here for Druid's guidelines:
https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

The Druid [druid_intellij_formatting.xml](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/raw/master/druid_intellij_formatting.xml) 
contains a Scala codestyle as well, which you can use to ensure your Scala code is formatted according to project 
conventions.

The [Druid CLA](http://druid.io/community/cla.html) applies to Tranquility as well. Please fill it out when
contributing to either project. The same form does apply to both projects, so there is no need to fill it out twice.
